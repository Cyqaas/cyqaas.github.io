            The most memorable project worked on within the four years was creating a bottom-up parser using C++ in CSE340: Principles of Programming Language. Managed a score of 184/200 and taught me the following:
            <ul>
                <li> Consider normal and abnormal edge cases when developing a program.</li>
                <li> Remember to take breaks as time away could help clear the mind and lead to solutions.</li>
                <li> Do not be afraid to reach out to peers if stuck on a problem. </li>
            </ul>
