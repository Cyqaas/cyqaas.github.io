            <p>August 2020 - May 2024</p>
            <p>As a Computer Science student at ASU, my journey started by learning Java to develop a foundation of object-oriented programming. Later learning C# and C++ to learn Data Structures and Algorithms, develop parser programs, and deepen my understanding of OOP. As for front-end development, HTML5 and CSS were used to structure and style elements which utilized API calls through JavaScript to create functional websites. </p>
            <p>As the years passed, new skills were developed and on-going ones were strengthened. Beginning with perseverance, being consistent and having courage in the face of daunting tasks helped me develop confidence in overcoming these obstacles. Next up, communication, learning not to be afraid to reach out for help and conversing with peers about topics cleared up confusion and led to deeper understanding of those ideas through different perspectives. Finally, the importance of taking breaks, throughout various projects and assignments there were times I did problems repeatedly leading to absolutely nowhere and taking a break from these tasks helped me come back with a clear mind to identify mistakes and come up with a solution.</p>
            <p>Overall, my time spent at ASU was well worth it as I was the first in my Latino family to obtain a college degree, as well as develop new and strengthen existing skills which not only extend to my career path but personal life. </p>

            </a>
            <p>January 2022 - Current</p>
            <p>My time at In-N-Out Burger has been filled with great experiences, people, and culture. Starting out as a level 1, I was the usual order taker and dining room host our guests would see when they walk in. As time passed and I reached my level 4, this transitionary period was filled with grit, determination, and strengthening my poor communication skills as in the beginning I was a very closed off individual.</p>
            <p>As my time as a level 4 drew to a close and I primarily became a clean-up crew member at store 148, I would learn to appreciate the experience and moments when I was working within the stand. Becoming one of the main clean-up members at this location allowed me to appreciate members of society that clean up after others and do preventive maintenance on appliances to ensure they are in the best state to do what they were designed for. Moreover, this new role would allow me to communicate directly with my store manager about fixing or maintaining appliances, feedback on how both parties could improve, and reveal to me that cleaning is something I enjoy doing.</p>
            <p>All in all, I appreciate all In-N-Out has provided for me in terms of benefits, experience, and life-long career skills. This is a great company to work for and I am glad to be part of one of the busiest stores in Arizona, store 148! </p>

            <p>January 2021 - Current</p>
            <p>Weightlifting, not to be confused with Olympic Weightlifting, has been an important staple of my life as it has helped me stay in shape, develop the grit to become as strong as I naturally can, and apply discipline to different aspects of my life.</p>
            <p>Starting out was a difficult journey as I had no prior sports or lifting experience so working out your muscles was a surreal concept to me. Being a gamer goblin prior to lifting did not help either! As time went on I developed a mind to muscle connection and lifting became second nature to me.</p>
            <p>As of August 2024, my best numbers at 183lbs/83kgs are:</p>

            <p>2012 - Current</p>
            <p>Gaming has held a special place in my heart as without it I would not have been able to make great friends and memories. From playing Minecraft on the Xbox 360 version and building dirt houses to anticipating the releases of GTA6 and Black Ops 6 with my friends, gaming has remained a source of happiness within my life. Although the friend group is getting older and we carry more responsibilities, I would like to appreciate them for helping me get through tough obstacles, the great memories, and developing life changing skills outside of gaming. </p>
